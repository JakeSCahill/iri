## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [IOTA Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

To contribute to IRI, you can do any of the following:

- Report a bug
- Suggest a new feature
- Build a new feature
- Contribute to the documentation

## Report a bug

This section guides you through reporting a bug. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand the bug, reproduce the behavior, and find related bugs.

### Before reporting a bug

Please check the following list:

- **Do not open a GitHub issue for [security vulnerabilities](SECURITY.MD)**, instead, please contact us at [security@iota.org](mailto:security@iota.org).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [**Issues**](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/issues). If the bug has already been reported **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. You can also find related issues by their [label](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc). For example, if your issue is database related, filter issues based on the `C-DB` label to look for related ones. `C` stands for component.

**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems similar to what you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Submitting A Bug Report

To report a bug, [open a new issue](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/issues/new), and be sure include as many details as possible, using the template.

If you also want to fix the bug, submit a [pull request](#pull-requests) and reference the issue.

## Suggest a new feature

This section guides you through suggesting a new feature. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community collaborate to find the best possible way forward with your suggestion.

### Before suggesting a new feature

**Ensure the feature has not already been suggested** by searching on GitHub under [**Issues**](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/issues).

### Suggesting a new feature

To suggest a new feature, talk to the IOTA community and IOTA Foundation members in the #iri-discussion channel on [Discord](https://discord.iota.org/).

If the IRI team agrees that your feature is necessary, the team will create an issue for it.

## Build a new feature

This section guides you through building a new feature. Following these guidelines helps give your feature the best chance of being approved and merged.

### Before building a new feature

Make sure to discuss the feature in the #iri-discussion channel on [Discord](https://discord.iota.org/).

Otherwise, your feature may not be approved at all.

### Building a new feature

To build a new feature, check out a new branch based on the `dev` branch, and be sure to consider the following:

- If the feature has a public facing API, make sure to document it, using Javadoc code comments

- Where necessary, please write regression tests for your feature. Refer to our current [regression tests](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/tree/dev/python-regression) for guidance.

## Contribute to the IRI documentation

The IOTA documentation is based in the [documentation](https://github.com/iotaledger/documentation) repository. You are welcome to contribute.

## Pull Requests

When creating a pull request, please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the PR template
2. Follow the [code styleguide](STYLEGUIDE.md)
3. After you submit your pull request, make sure that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

**Note:** Reviewers may ask you to complete additional work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be approved and merged.
